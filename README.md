Saaransh means Summary or result of a thoughtful process

Collaborative learning is a method of teaching and learning in which students team together to explore a significant question or create a meaningful project. A group of students discussing a lecture or students from different schools working together over the Internet on a shared assignment are both examples of collaborative learning. 

In small groups, students can share strengths and also develop their weaker skill s. They develop their interpersonal skills. They learn to deal with conflict. When cooperative groups are guided by clear objectives, students engage in numerous activities that improve their understanding of subjects explored.

Saaransh is Android App for creation  of summary from audio and for managing the Study Clubs.

  - Record the audio and get short summarized notes
  - Create Study groups to share the notes among fellow students
  - Get youtube recommendation based on the topics of notes.

This app allows to collaborate users of same interests in a club where they can share their doubts, new foundings, and notes which might be useful to their fellow students. 

We're adding features to use microphone of a smartphone to take text from speech which can be saved by user, they can also take picture of a document and extract text from the image. 

Users will be asked the topics which they are interested in and using that information they can be suggested Study Buddies or Study Clubs. The main focus of this app is to allow users to collaborate in the topics they want to learn. It also tries to summarize large paragraphs if user want. They can share their notes into clubs.


Users can sign up using google account. we have used Google Firebase Database, Vision, Ml APIs for storing, recognizing Images, and extract tet from speech. To Tokanize and Summarize we're currently using nltk and sumy respectively. We can improve the model by using/ training a better model.
The server is on localhost in flask.
